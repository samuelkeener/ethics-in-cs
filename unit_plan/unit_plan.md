# Ethics in CS
by Sam Keener

---

## General Overview 
This unit will cover topics such as ethics in business, racist algorithms, the future of automation, mass user attacks, personal data privacy, 
and anonymity and internet conduct.  This would be a post-test unit in the AP CS A course.

---

## Motivation for Unit
A lot of computer science courses teach students excellent problem solving skills, logic, and coding, but few of them tackle 
issues of ethics in computer science. In the AP CS A course description, it mentions examining the “legal and ethical implications of 
computer programming,” but there are no official materials or units for it as of yet, and the test ignores it entirely. I have been 
enjoying our discussions of Ethics in Computer Science and think that my students would benefit from it as well.

## Standards Referenced
I'll be using the Rhode Island CS Education Standards, as they have robust sections on Responsible Computing in Society that I think I
can reference when writing my lessons.

---

## Tools Used

Since this is a Java course, any coding would be done in Java.  Ethics debates would make use of Slack and Padlet for posting statements
and gallery walks.

## Lessons

Total length: 2.5 weeks

## Week 1: The Government’s Role

### Lesson 1:  Ethics in Business – Do companies have an obligation to “do the right thing” if it reduces profits?
-	Day 1: Scruples Game: Randomly choose two  of several scenarios and take the role of CEO.  What decision would you make and why?
-	Day 2: Virtual Gallery Walk 
- How did people respond differently in each individual situation?
-	Did people have a consensus on how to react in certain situations?
-	How did the type of situation affect whether a consensus was reached, and what that consensus was?
###	Lesson 2 : Fixing a Racist Algorithm – Should the government step in?
-	Day 1: Students analyze results of an algorithm that chooses which applicants get loans and which don’t.  The algorithm uses data based on income, employment status & history, credit rating, and place of residence.  For one reason or another, the algorithm disproportionately awards loans to white applicants and denies them to non-white applicants.  Brainstorm ways to change the algorithm (adding or removing data fields if necessary).    
-	Day 2: Legislation.  What can be done to ensure “fairness” in how these algorithms operate? What defines fairness?  Could these algorithms be considered discrimination?  Draft some laws to combat this issue, or argue why the laws shouldn’ change.
-	Day 3: SQL introduction and practice using a database for good/evil?  
###	Lesson 3: Replacing Humans With Machines – Should the government try to prevent it?
-	Day 1: Is it ethical to replace manual laborers with machines?  Read an article about solutions to a post-automation society and choose one of two stances: prevent it, or embrace it.  For those choosing to prevent it: what legislation would you enact to do so?  For those choosing to embrace, what would our post-automation society look like, and how do we fight unemployment?
-	Day 2: Switch and debate.  Students will pair off two and two to create a poster (or Jamboard) representing both sides of the debate.  Highlight major issues of both sides and identify possible compromises and agreements between the two sides.
##	Week 2: The Individual
###	Lesson 4: Review Bombing and K-Pop - Is trolling the same as protesting?
-	What are the ethical concerns of review bombing and mass trolling (K-Pop Trump Rally example).  When are these things justified?  When are they not?  Find two examples of mass user “attacks”, one you feel was justifiable and one you feel was not and explain why.  Come up with a rule or set of rules that people can use to decide if this is justified. (i.e. who is the target? What is the reasoning? What is the nature of the “attack”? etc.)
###	Lesson 5: Personal Data Privacy – What responsibilities should and shouldn’t fall on the user in regards to their photos?
-	Which photos should a person expect to stay private?  Should posting something on your Facebook feed be considered public?  What if somebody else posts it? Read the privacy policy for a number of photo sharing sites (Instagram, Facebook, etc.) and write a guide for people to avoid their photos being public against their will and/or knowledge. 
###	Lesson 6: Anonymity and Internet Conduct – How should a person conduct themselves online?  Should they be held accountable in the “real world” for things said on social media?
-	Scruples game: Select a social media post with controversial or inflammatory statements.  You are that person’s boss.  What do you do?
###	Lesson 7: Bringing it All Together – Who has more responsibility?
-	Looking back at each of the previous lessons, who should hold the majority of the responsibility to act ethically?  Should companies and individuals be trusted to make the “right” decisions, or should they be forced to?  Which is more likely to happen in each of these scenarios: people acting ethically, or the government passing legislation?
